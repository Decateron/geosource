# User Manual

### Browsing Posts

##### Flags

Generally the flags limit posts which are shown, and are ANDed together rather than ORed. So if "Visible" and "Favorites" are checked, only posts which are both visible AND favorited will be shown.

* **Visible** - If checked, only posts which are visible within the current map area are shown in the feed.
* **All** - If checked, all posts types of posts will be shown
* **Mine** - If all is unchecked and this is checked, only posts which were created by the current user will be shown
* **Favorites** - If all is unchecked and this is checked, only posts which are favorited by the current user will be shown
* **Subscriptions** - If all is unchecked and this is checked, only posts which are within channels to which the user is subscribed will be shown
